Hello everyone,

Helloween is behind us and it did not scare us away from hosting another Ruby meetup in Brno, Czech Republic.

We have space for talks, lightning talks, networking, and contribution to Ruby community.
If you'd be interested in participating, feel free to reach out on out [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#brugcz:matrix.org).

This time we'd be meeting at [Students club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nhNGYuUAfW1HuuDG8) called "Kachna" at Brno University of Technology.
According to the website, the best way to get to the club is to enter [gate at Metodějova street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B013'37.2%22N+16%C2%B035'42.0%22E/@49.2274345,16.5952445,67a,35y,199.17h,39.47t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d49.227!4d16.595?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEwNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and walk straight, until there's a door with a picture of a duck on it.

Take your friends and come meet with us, entry is free and we're looking forward to everyone!
